1. Write a blog on the Difference between document and window objects

The document object is an object that represents the documents of a web pages that is the HTML documents
as the object. It is a programming interface for the web documents and it represents the page so that
can change the document structure,  style, and content. As this document object represents the document
as nodes and objects programming languages can interact with the page

Usually, a webpage is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML
sources. In both these cases, it is the same document. The document object is a document itself and 
allows us to change this document to manipulated such as changing the structure, style and content.

Let's understand how this object happens;
When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser, it becomes as a document object and that 
docuemnt object will become the root node of the HTML docuemnt that it will be the owner of all
other nodes.
